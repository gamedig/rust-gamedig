-
    - 7 Days to Die: `7d2d` in definitions and `sd2d` in game declaration -> `sdtd`.
-
    - Quake 3 Arena: `quake3arena` -> `q3a`.
-
    - Unreal tournament 2003: `ut2003` -> `unrealtournament2003`

      change includes Structs, Enum and game id renames, also removed the "v" from the game definition name.
-
    - Moved the Minecraft protocol implementation in the games folder as its proprietary.

Protocols:

- Valve: Removed `SteamApp` due to it not being really useful at all, replaced all instances with `Engine`.

Query:

    - Sockets are now expected to apply timeout settings in new()

# 0.4.1 - 13/10/2023

### Changes:

Game:

Crate:

- Added `Send` and `Sync` on `Error::source` to fix some async issues.

### Breaking...

None, yaay!

# 0.4.0 - 07/10/2023

### Changes:

Games:

- Rich errors, capturing backtrace is done on `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`. (by @Douile)
- Applied some nursery Clippy lints.
- The `retries` field was added to `TimeoutSettings` that specifies the number of times to retry a failed request (
  request being individual send, receive sequence, some protocols can include multiple requests in a single query). (by
  @Douile)
    - By default `retries` is set to `0`, meaning no retries will be attempted

Generics:

- Added `ExtraRequestSettings` containing all possible extra request settings. (by @Douile)
- Added `query_with_timeout_and_extra_settings()` to allow generic queries with extra settings. (by @Douile)

### Breaking...

Crate:

- The enum used for errors, `GDError` has been renamed to `GDErrorKind`.
- `GDError` is now a struct that holds its kind, the source and a backtrace.
- The `Socket::apply_timeout` method now borrows `TimeoutSettings` (`&Option<TimeoutSettings>`)
    - To make this easier to work with a new method was added
      to `TimeoutSettings`: `TimeoutSettings::get_read_and_write_or_defaults` this takes a borrowed
      optional `TimeoutSettings` and returns the contained read and write durations or the default read and write
      durations.

Generics:

- Renamed `CommonResponseJson`'s `game` field (and the function) to `game_mode`.
- Changed `players_maximum` and `players_online` (and their functions) types from `u64` to `u32`.
- Changed `score` type (and the function) of player from `u32` to `i32`.

Games:

2. Renamed `version` to `game_version`.
3. Renamed `game` to `game_mode`.
4. Fixed `player`'s `score` field being `u32` when it needed to be `i32`, as specified in the protocol.
5. Added the field `check_app_id` to `GatherSettings` which controls if the app id specified to the request and
   reported by the server are the same, errors if not, enabled by default. (by @Douile)
6. Valve: Renamed SteamApp enum variants to match new definition names

- GameSpy (1, 2, 3):

1. Renamed `version` to `game_version`.
2. Changed `players_maximum` and `players_online` (and their functions) types from `usize` to `u32`.

- GameSpy 1:

1. Renamed the player's `frags` to `score` and type from `u32` to `i32`.
2. Made `Option` the following response fields `team`, `face`, `skin`, `mesh` and `secret` to fix missing fields
   issues. (by @Douile)

- Quake (1, 2):

1. Renamed `game_type` to `game_mode`.
2. Changed `version` type from `String`to `Option<String>`.

- Minecraft Java

1. Renamed `version_protocol` to `protocol_version`.
2. Renamed `version_name` to `game_version`.
3. Renamed `players_sample` to `players`.
4. Added an optional parameter, `RequestSettings`, which contains fields that are used when creating the handshake
   packet (this solves some servers not responding to the query). (by @Douile)
5. Legacy versions naming has been changed to represent up to what version they can query, `LegacyBV1_8` (Beta 1.8 to
   1.3) -> `LegacyV1_3` and `LegacyV1_4` (1.4 to 1.5) -> `LegacyV1_5` (and their enums accordingly).

- Minecraft Bedrock

1. Renamed `version_protocol` to `protocol_version`.

- Minecraft:

1. Added an optional parameter, `request_settings` parameter to `query`.

- The Ship:

1. Renamed `protocol` to `protocol_version`.
2. Renamed `max_players` to `players_maximum` and changed its type from `u64` to `u32`.
3. Renamed `bots` to `players_bots`. and changed its type from `u64` to `u32`.
4. Renamed `players` to `players_online`.
5. Renamed `players_details` to `players`.
6. Renamed `game` to `game_mode`.
7. Added field `game_version`.

  thanks [@Douile](https://github.com/Douile) for the re-re-write).
- Protocols now use `&SocketAddr` instead of `address: &str, port: u16`.

Services:

- Valve Master Query:

1. Removed Filter and SearchFilters lifetimes and changed `&'a str` to `String` and `&'a [&'a str]` to `Vec<String>`

# 0.2.2 - 01/05/2023

### Changes:

Crate:

- General optimizations thanks to [cargo clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
  and [@cainthebest](https://github.com/cainthebest).
- Added feature `serde` which enables json serialization/deserialization for all types (

- GameSpy 1: `players_minimum` is now an `Option<u8>` instead of an `u8`
- GameSpy 1: Is now under `protocols::gamespy::one` instead of `protocols::gamespy`

# 0.2.1 - 03/03/2023

### Changes:

Crate:

- Added feature `no_games` which disables the supported games (useful when only the
  protocols/services are needed, also saves storage space).

Games:

- GameSpy 1 support.

### Breaking:

None.

# 0.2.0 - 18/02/2023

### Changes:

Games:

- [Don't Starve Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/) support.
- [Colony Survival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366090/Colony_Survival/) support.

- [Operation: Harsh Doorstop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736590/Operation_Harsh_Doorstop/) support.

Protocols:

- Valve:

1. `appid` is now a field in the `Response` struct.

### Breaking:

Protocols:

- Valve:
  due to some games being able to host a server from within the game AND from a dedicated server,
  if you were to query one of them, the query would fail for the other one, as the `SteamID` enum
  for that game could specify only one id.

1. `SteamID` is now `SteamApp`, was an u32 enum, and now it's a simple enum.
2. `App` is now `Engine`, the `Source` enum's structure has been changed from `Option<u32>` to
   `Option<u32, Option<u32>>`, where the first parameter is the game app id and the second is
   the dedicated server app id (if there is one).

# 0.1.0 - 17/01/2023

- [Age of Chivalry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17510/Age_of_Chivalry/) support.

Protocols:

- Valve: Players with no name are no more added to the `players_details` field.
- Valve: Split packets are now appending in the correct order.

Crate:

- `MSRV` is now `1.56.1` (was `1.58.1`)

### Breaking:

Protocols:

- Valve: The rules field is now a `HashMap<String, String>` instead of a `Vec<ServerRule>` (where the `ServerRule`
  structure had a name and a value fields).
- Valve: Structs that contained the `players`, `max_players` and `bots` fields have been renamed
  to `players_online`, `players_maximum` and `players_bots` respectively.
- Minecraft: Structs that contained the `online_players`, `max_players` and `sample_players` fields have been renamed
  to `players_online`, `players_maximum` and `players_sample` respectively.
- Minecraft: The Java query response struct named `Response` has been renamed to `JavaResponse`.

Errors:

- Besides the `BadGame` error, now no other errors returns details about what happened (as it was quite pointless).

Crate:

- `package.metadata.msrv` has been replaced with `package.rust-version`

# 0.0.7 - 03/01/2023

### Changes:

[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.com) bedrock edition support.  
Fix Minecraft legacy v1.6 max/online players count being reversed.  
Added `query_legacy_specific` method to the Minecraft protocol.

### Breaking:

Some public functions that are meant to be used only internally were made private.

# 0.0.6 - 28/11/2022

[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.com) support (bedrock not supported yet).  
[7 Days To Die](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/) support.

[Half-Life Deathmatch: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/360/HalfLife_Deathmatch_Source/) support.  
Successfully tested `Alien Swarm` and `Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat`.  
Restored rules response for `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive` (note: for a full player list response, the
cvar `host_players_show` must be set to `2`).  
Increased Valve Protocol `PACKET_SIZE` from 1400 to 6144 (because some games send larger packets than the specified
protocol size).  
Removed DNS resolving as it was not needed.  
Valve Protocol minor optimizations.

# 0.0.5 - 15/11/2022

Added `SocketBind` error, regarding failing to bind a socket.  
Socket custom timeout capability (with an error if provided durations are zero).  
Because of this, a parameter similar to GatherSettings has been added on the Valve Protocol Query.
Support for GoldSrc split packets and obsolete A2S_INFO response.  
Changed the Valve Protocol app parameter to represent the engine responses.
It is now an enum of:

- `Source(Option<u32>)` - A Source response with optionally, the id (if the id is present and the response id is not the
  same, the query fails), if it isn't provided, find it.
- `GoldSrc(bool)` - A GoldSrc response with the option to enforce the obsolete A2S_INFO response.

Fixed Source multi-packet response crash due to when a certain app with a certain protocol doesn't have the Size
field.  
Reduced Valve Protocol `PACKET_SIZE` to be as specified from 2048 to 1400.  
[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero](https://store.steampowered.com/app/80/CounterStrike_Condition_Zero/) implementation.  
[Day of Defeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/30/Day_of_Defeat/) implementation.  
Games besides CSGO and TS now have the same response structure.

# 0.0.4 - 23/10/2022

Queries now support DNS resolve.  
Changed uses a bit, example: from `use gamedig::valve::ValveProtocol::query`
to `use gamedig::protocols::valve::query`.  
Changed Valve Protocol Query parameters to (ip, port, app, gather_settings), changes include:

- the app is now optional, being None means to anonymously query the server.
- gather_settings is now also an optional, being None means all query settings.

Valve Protocol now supports querying anonymous apps (see previous lines).  
Better bad game error.  
[Alien Swarm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/630/Alien_Swarm/) implementation (not tested).  
[Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/) implementation.  
[Insurgency](https://store.steampowered.com/app/222880/Insurgency/) implementation.  
[Insurgency: Sandstorm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/581320/Insurgency_Sandstorm/) implementation.  
[Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17700/INSURGENCY_Modern_Infantry_Combat/)
implementation (not tested).

# 0.0.3 - 22/10/2022

Valve protocol now properly supports multi-packet responses (compressed ones not tested).  
CSGO, TF2 and TS now have independent Responses, if you want a generic one, query the protocol.  
[Counter Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/) implementation (if protocol is 7,
queries with multi-packet responses will crash).  
[Day of Defeat: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/300/Day_of_Defeat_Source/) implementation.  
[Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) implementation.  
[Half-Life 2 Deathmatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320/HalfLife_2_Deathmatch/) implementation.  
[Left 4 Dead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/500/Left_4_Dead/) implementation.  
[Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) implementation.

# 0.0.2 - 20/10/2022

Further implementation of the Valve protocol (PLAYERS and RULES queries).  
[Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/)
implementation.  
[The Ship](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/The_Ship) implementation.  
The library now has error handling.

# 0.0.1 - 16/10/2022

The first usable version of the crate, yay!  
It brings:  
Initial implementation of the [Valve server query protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries).  
Initial [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) support.

# 0.0.0 - 15/10/2022

The first *markdown*, the crate is unusable as it doesn't contain anything helpful.
