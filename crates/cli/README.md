## Community
Checkout the GameDig Community Discord Server [here](https://discord.gg/NVCMn3tnxH).  
Note that it isn't be a replacement for GitHub issues, if you have found a problem
within the library or want to request a feature, it's better to do so here rather than
on Discord.

## Usage
Just by running `gamedig-cli` prints the usage.  
**Note**: Passing `--help` (or `-h`) shows the usage.

Here's also a quick rundown of a simple query with the `json-pretty` format:

Pick a game/service/protocol (check the [GAMES](https://github.com/gamedig/rust-gamedig/blob/main/GAMES.md), [SERVICES](https://github.com/gamedig/rust-gamedig/blob/main/SERVICES.md) and [PROTOCOLS](https://github.com/gamedig/rust-gamedig/blob/main/PROTOCOLS.md) files to see the currently supported ones), provide the ip and the port (be aware that some game servers use a separate port for the info queries, the port can also be optional if the server is running the default ports) then query on it.

[Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/) query example:
```
gamedig-cli query -g teamfortress2 -i 127.0.0.1 -f json-pretty
```
What we are doing here:
* `-g` (or `--game`) specifies the game.
* `-i` (or `--ip`) target ip.
* `-f` (or `--format`) our preferred format.

Note: We haven't specified a port (via `-p` or `--port`), so the default one for the game will be used (`27015` in this case).

Response (note that some games have a different structure):
```json
{
  "name": "A cool server.",
  "description": null,
  "game_mode": "Team Fortress",
  "game_version": "8690085",
  "map": "cp_foundry",
  "players_maximum": 24,
  "players_online": 0,
  "players_bots": 0,
  "has_password": false,
  "players": []
}
```
