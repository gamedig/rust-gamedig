**Warning**: This project goes through frequent API breaking changes and hasn't been thoroughly tested.

**rust-GameDig** is a game servers/services query library that fetches the availability and details of those, this library brings what **[node-GameDig](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig)** does, to pure Rust!  

Minimum Supported Rust Version is `1.56.1` and the code is cross-platform.

Check out the GameDig Community Discord Server [here](https://discord.gg/NVCMn3tnxH).

## Games/Services/Protocols List
To see the supported (or the planned to support) games/services/protocols, see [GAMES](GAMES.md), [SERVICES](SERVICES.md) and [PROTOCOLS](PROTOCOLS.md) respectively.

## Usage
Just pick a game/service/protocol, provide the ip and the port (be aware that some game servers use a separate port for the info queries, the port can also be optional if the server is running the default ports) then query on it.  
[Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/) query example:
```rust
use gamedig::games::tf2;

fn main() {
    let response = tf2::query("127.0.0.1", None); // None is the default port (which is 27015), could also be Some(27015)
    match response { // Result type, must check what it is...
        Err(error) => println!("Couldn't query, error: {}", error),
        Ok(r) => println!("{:#?}", r)
    }
}
```
Response (note that some games have a different structure):
```json5
{
  protocol: 17,
  name: "Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server.",
  map: "ctf_turbine",
  game: "tf2",
  appid: 440,
  players_online: 0,
  players_details: [],
  players_maximum: 69,
  players_bots: 0,
  server_type: Dedicated,
  has_password: false,
  vac_secured: true,
  version: "7638371",
  port: Some(27015),
  steam_id: Some(69753253289735296),
  tv_port: None,
  tv_name: None,
  keywords: Some("alltalk,nocrits"),
  rules: [
    "mp_autoteambalance": "1",
    "mp_maxrounds": "5",
    //....
  ]
}
```
