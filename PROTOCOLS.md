A protocol is defined as proprietary if it is being used only for a single scope (or series, like Minecraft).

# Supported protocols:
| Name           | For   | Proprietary? | Documentation reference                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Unreal2        | Games  | Yes         | [Node-GameDig Source](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig) | Sometimes servers send strings that node-gamedig would treat as latin1 that are UTF-8 encoded, when this happens the remove color code breaks because latin1 decodes the colour sequences differently. Some games provide additional info at the end of the server info packet, this is not currently handled (see the node implementation). Some games use a bot player to denote the team names, this is not currently handled. |
